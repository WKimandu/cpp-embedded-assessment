# C++ Embedded Systems Exercise

## Overview
This exercise tests your ability to develop a real-time system using C++ with focus on memory management, thread safety, and performance optimization.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Thread-Safe Queue Implementation
   - Lock-free queue design
   - Memory management
   - Thread synchronization
   - Performance optimization

2. Real-time Event Processing
   - Event queue management
   - Priority handling
   - Deadline management
   - Resource allocation

3. Memory Management
   - Custom memory pool
   - Memory allocation strategies
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Performance monitoring

4. Hardware Interaction
   - GPIO simulation
   - Interrupt handling
   - Device communication
   - Error handling

### Technical Requirements
- C++17 or later
- CMake build system
- Google Test framework
- Valgrind for memory analysis
- Docker for containerization
